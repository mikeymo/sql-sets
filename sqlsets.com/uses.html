			<h2><b>Examples of How People Are Using SQL Sets</b></h2>

				<h3><strong>I&#39;m a Developer</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re unit testing coding changes that will result 
				in updates to multiple tables in a database.</strong> Use SQL 
				Sets to take a BEFORE snapshot of the tables and rows that will 
				be affected by the change. Then, after changes have been 
				implemented an tested, use SQL Sets to take an AFTER snapshot of 
				that same slice of data. You now have two distinct files that 
				provide a snapshot in time that can be compared and analyzed to 
				facilitate testing.</p>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re working with a team of Testers to validate a 
				system. The Testing Team does not have direct access to the 
				database, but would like to analyze some data.</strong> Use SQL 
				Sets to extract the appropriate slice of data into a Portable 
				Data Document. This file can then be handed off to the Testing 
				Team where they can then perform their analysis. If issues are 
				found, they can add Bookmarks and/or Annotations to the set and 
				forward it back to the Development Team for further action.</p>
				<p><strong>On a daily basis you work with and need to refer to a 
				handful of Lookup/Reference tables in your application&#39;s 
				database.</strong> Use SQL Sets to save a snapshot of these 
				tables. Then, the contents of these tables are readily available 
				without constantly re-running the same queries over and over. 
				Bookmarking, in conjunction with the Table Navigator pane, make 
				finding what you&#39;re looking for faster and easier.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry"><a name="testers"></a>
				<h3><strong>I&#39;m a Tester/QA Analyst</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re testing a new system and notice some 
				issues with the way the data is being stored in the database.</strong> 
				Use SQL Sets to extract the appropriate slice of data into a 
				Portable Data Document. Then, use Bookmarks to focus in on the 
				problematic data and Annotations to clarify the issues. Save the 
				file and include it as an addendum to the bug report in your 
				organization&#39;s Issue Tracking System or forward it on to the 
				developer(s) you&#39;re working with so they can address it.</p>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re testing a system and suspect there are 
				data related issues. You do not have direct access to the 
				database.</strong> Ask a member of the Development Team or the 
				DBA to use SQL Sets to extract the data for you into a Portable 
				Data Document. Use this document to perform your analysis and 
				annotate as required. This document can then serve as a source 
				document in a bug report or forwarded back to the developer(s) 
				so they can address it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry"><a name="analysts"></a>
				<h3><strong>I&#39;m a Business/Systems Analyst</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re working with the business to get sign-off on 
				some Lookup/Reference data that will be displayed on an 
				application&#39;s screens and/or on reports.</strong> 
				Use SQL Sets to extract the appropriate tables into a 
				Portable Data Document. Forward this onto the business person(s) 
				you&#39;re working with. Have them use Annotations and Bookmarks to 
				notate any issues they find. Use this document as the basis for 
				any data clean-up that may be required.</p>
				<p><strong>The application you&#39;re working with includes some 
				fairly involved financial calculations. There is a discrepancy 
				in one or more of the results being calculated.</strong> Use SQL 
				Sets to capture the source and intermediate data that is being 
				used in the calculations. Forward this document to the Financial 
				and/or Actuarial Analysts who understand this data best. They 
				can then perform an analysis on it and help make a determination 
				as to where the issue lies.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry"><a name="dbas"></a>
				<h3><strong>I&#39;m a Database Administrator (DBA)</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re working with the Development Team to test 
				a data conversion effort.</strong> Use SQL 
				Sets to take a BEFORE snapshot of the tables and rows that will 
				be affected by the change. Then, after the conversion has been 
				run, use SQL Sets to take an AFTER snapshot of 
				that same slice of data. You now have two distinct files that 
				provide a snapshot in time that can be compared and analyzed to 
				facilitate testing.</p>
				<p><strong>You want to keep track of how the nature of certain 
				data is changing over time. This might include the size of the 
				data, row counts or just the content in general.</strong> Use 
				SQL Sets to craft a collection of queries that will give you the 
				results you&#39;re interested in. On a periodic basis, re-run these 
				queries and save the file as Portable Data Document that 
				provides a snapshot of that moment in time. You now have a 
				collection of files that provide an historical perspective on 
				the data of interest.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="entry"><a name="auditors"></a>
				<h3><strong>I&#39;m an Auditor</strong></h3>
				<p><strong>You&#39;re an internal auditor who has been tasked with 
				making sure a line-of-business application is effectively and 
				reliably performing its function.</strong> At the heart of most 
				corporate systems is a relational database. Use SQL Sets to 
				capture and analyze a slice of the database to verify data 
				integrity and consistency. Through the use of Bookmarks and 
				Annotations, this data can then be augmented to high-light any 
				problems or areas of concern. This Portable Data Document can 
				then become one of the formal source documents of the audit. </p>
